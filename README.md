I am a Software Engineer focused on scalable system design, microservice architecture, and algorithmic efficiency. Currently, I build full-stack solutions using Java (Spring Boot) and Angular. I enjoy taking ownership of meaningful projects and collaborating in agile teams to solve real-world problems.
